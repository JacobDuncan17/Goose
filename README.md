# Professional Portfolio

This project was creating a professional portfolio to show off my work.
This project includes:
* A nav bar that takes you to each section of the html page.
* An about me section with a picture of myself and name.
* Pictures of my work that link to the published pages.
* When the site is viewed on any device it adapts to your viewport
